Title: Feature Extraction from RS‐HR data using AIML with Seamless mosaic visualization using Radiometric normalization

Description: Bhuvan hosts various satellite imagery ranging from low to High Resolution satellite imagery. Point features & Linear features can be extracted from satellite imagery. Feature extraction at this scale invites novelty and thinking out of the box. These images are acquired with time span of one month to few years depending upon acquisition capability of satellites to cover entire Indian landmass. The radiometric normalization on these datasets will be challenging to generate the seamless mosaic.
Objectives:
1.	Aircraft, Oil Storage, Wind Turbine, Tree, Buildings.(Point Features Extraction)
2.	Linear Features Extraction like Road, Railway line, River footprint from LISS - IV
3.	Radiometric normalization of LISS-III satellite images for better visualization of features 

Expected Outcomes:
1.	Generate dataset with classwise labels, different features being different class.
2.	Multi‐label classification model with good generalization capability. 
3.	Better radiometric normalization method for mosaic creation for improved visualization.

Relevant data and steps to get the data from Bhuvan/ other sources:
1.	Use any high resolution satellite data from Bhuvan portal or any other open‐source resources.
2.	Use Bhoonidhi/Bhvuan Portal to get LISS-IV and LISS-III images
